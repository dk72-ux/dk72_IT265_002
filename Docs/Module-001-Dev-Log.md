#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate -->
- [ ] Goal 1: Figure out what kind of game I want to make
- [ ] Goal 2: Come up with some concept art & do the appropriate research
- [ ] Goal 3: Finalize what type of game I want to build
- [ ] Goal 4: Block-out a crude build in Unity & figure out basic coding (get TA or prof assistance where needed)


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Researched rogue-likes and other vampire survivors-esque games to figure out the game feel
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Rogue-like structure & game loop
- UI/UX design for menus & popups

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I want to make a vampire survivors esque game where you have to survive as long as you can while leveling up & gaining more powerups
-  Powerups boost survivability & damage potential
-  Enemies should vary in both typing and attack frequency
- Figure out how to build the powerup menu selection screen
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
