#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate-->
- [ ] Goal 1: Finalize class archetypes (Tank, Warrior, Healer)
- [ ] Goal 2: Consider turn-based balancing & programing
- [ ] Goal 3: Consider color theory & palette for game assets
- [ ] Goal 4: (Maybe) Draw sprites for each class 


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Changed game idea to something more feasible & reasonable ... ie. turn-based gameplay instead of a rogue-like
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Figure out a "rock-paper-scissors" balancing system
  - Figure out a three-class system to build around the balancing system
  - Consider what abilities each class has & the number of abilities (pick what will make balance easy & fun)
  - Color code each class and their respective abilities
  - What would determine turn order?
- **Solutions**:
  - Settle on an idea & commit to it. Don't get lost in scope-creep

#### Learnings
- Rock-paper-scissor balancing

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Figure out the color palette (Adobe color palettes maybe?)
- What would differentiate one ability from another?
- What would engage the player?
- What should the soundscape be like?
