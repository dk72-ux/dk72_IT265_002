#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate-->
- [ ] Goal 1: Continue workign on video game concepts
- [ ] Goal 2: Consider turn-based balancing & game design


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Changed game idea to something more feasible & reasonable ... ie. turn-based gameplay instead of a rogue-like
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Figure out a "rock-paper-scissors" balancing system
  - Figure out a three-class system to build around the balancing system
  - Consider what abilities each class has & the number of abilities (pick what will make balance easy & fun)
- **Solutions**:
  - Settle on an idea & commit to it. Don't get lost in scope-creep

#### Learnings
- Rock-paper-scissor balancing

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Figure out the art direction
- Figure out immersion & mechanics
- What would engage the player?
- What should the soundscape be like?
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Refine the idea of a turn-based game & figure out the art direction
